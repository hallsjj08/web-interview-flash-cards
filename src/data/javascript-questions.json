    "question": "What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript",
    "answer": "There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:\n   1. **Object literal syntax:**\n      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.\n      ```javascript\n      var object = {\n           name: \"Sudheer\",\n           age: 34\n      };\n      ```\n      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.\n      **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object.\n   2. **Object constructor:**\n      The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n      ```javascript\n      var object = new Object();\n      ```\n      The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so \"new\" keyword is not required. The above code snippet can be re-written as:\n      ```javascript\n      var object = Object();\n      ```\n   3. **Object's create method:**\n      The `create` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specificied prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects.\n      The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.\n      The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.\n      ```javascript\n      var object = Object.create(null);\n      ```\n      The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.\n      ```javascript\n      let vehicle = {\n        wheels: '4',\n        fuelType: 'Gasoline',\n        color: 'Green'\n      }\n      let carProps = {\n        type: {\n          value: 'Volkswagen'\n        },\n        model: {\n          value: 'Golf'\n        }\n      }\n      var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);\n      console.log(car);\n      ```\n   4. **Function constructor:**\n      In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances.\n      ```javascript\n      function Person(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = 21;\n      }\n      var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n      ```\n   5. **Function constructor with prototype:**\n      This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,\n      ```javascript\n      function Person() {}\n      Person.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\n      var object = new Person();\n      ```\n      This is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n      ```javascript\n      function func() {}\n      new func(x, y, z);\n      ```\n      **(OR)**\n      ```javascript\n      // Create a new instance using function prototype.\n      var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)\n      // Call the function\n      var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),\n      // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\n      console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n      ```\n   6. **Object's assign method:**\n      The `Object.assign` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object.\n      The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.\n      ```javascript\n      const orgObject = { company: 'XYZ Corp'};\n      const carObject = { name: 'Toyota'};\n      const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);\n      ```\n   7. **ES6 Class syntax:**\n      ES6 introduces class feature to create objects.\n      ```javascript\n      class Person {\n        constructor(name) {\n          this.name = name;\n        }\n      }\n      var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n      ```\n   8. **Singleton pattern:**\n      A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.\n      ```javascript\n      var object = new (function () {\n        this.name = \"Sudheer\";\n      })();\n      ```\n      **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is a prototype chain",
    "answer": "**Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. i.e, When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, the created object inherits properties from a prototype object.\n   The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or **\\_\\_proto\\_\\_** property whereas prototype on constructor function is available through **Object.prototype**.\n   ![Screenshot](images/prototype_chain.png)\n   **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind",
    "answer": "The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,\n   **Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n   invite.call(employee1, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   invite.call(employee2, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n   **Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n   invite.apply(employee1, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   invite.apply(employee2, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n   **Bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n   var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);\n   var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);\n   inviteEmployee1(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   inviteEmployee2(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n   Call and Apply are pretty much interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether itâs easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.\n   Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().\n   **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is JSON and its common operations",
    "answer": "**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json\n   **Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object\n   ```javascript\n   JSON.parse(text);\n   ```\n   **Stringification:** Converting a native object to a string so that it can be transmitted across the network\n   ```javascript\n   JSON.stringify(object);\n   ```\n   **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is the purpose of the array slice method",
    "answer": "The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end of the array. This method can also accept negative index which counts back from the end of the array.\n   Some of the examples of this method are,\n   ```javascript\n   let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]\n   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]\n   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]\n   let arrayIntegers4 = arrayIntegers.slice(-3, -1); //returns [3, 4]\n   ```\n   **Note:** Slice method doesn't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.\n   **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is the purpose of the array splice method",
    "answer": "The **splice()** method adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position/index for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.\n   Some of the examples of this method are:\n   ```javascript\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]\n   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]\n   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 5]\n   ```\n   **Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.\n   **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "How do you compare Object and Map",
    "answer": "**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases:\n   1. The keys of an Object can be Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive type.\n   2. The keys in a Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in the order of insertion.\n   3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.\n   4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.\n   5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in an object that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by creating an object(which can be called a map) using `Object.create(null)`, but this practice is seldom done.\n   6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.\n   **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is the difference between == and === operators",
    "answer": "JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,\n   1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.\n   2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal, i.e., having the same number value.\n      There are two special cases in this,\n      1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.\n      2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.\n   3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.\n   4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.\n   5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with == .\n      i.e, `null===undefined --> false`, but `null==undefined --> true`\n   Some of the example which covers the above cases:\n   ```javascript\n   0 == false   // true\n   0 === false  // false\n   1 == \"1\"     // true\n   1 === \"1\"    // false\n   null == undefined // true\n   null === undefined // false\n   '0' == false // true\n   '0' === false // false\n   NaN == NaN or NaN === NaN // false\n   []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory\n   {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory\n   ```\n   **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

  {
    "question": "What is a pure function",
    "answer": "A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.\n    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,\n    ```javascript\n    //Impure\n    let numberArray = [];\n    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);\n    //Pure\n    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>\n      argNumberArray.concat([number]);\n    //Display the results\n    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    ```\n    As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value, whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.\n    Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with the **Immutability** concept of ES6: giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.\n    **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.\n    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,\n    ```javascript\n    const memoizAddition = () => {\n      let cache = {};\n      return (value) => {\n        if (value in cache) {\n          console.log(\"Fetching from cache\");\n          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.\n        } else {\n          console.log(\"Calculating result\");\n          let result = value + 20;\n          cache[value] = result;\n          return result;\n        }\n      };\n    };\n    // returned function from memoizAddition\n    const addition = memoizAddition();\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached\n    ```\n    **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is Hoisting",
    "answer": "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.\n    Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(message); //output : undefined\n    var message = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";\n    ```\n    The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,\n    ```javascript\n    var message;\n    console.log(message);\n    message = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";\n    ```\n    In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too\n    ```javascript\n    message(\"Good morning\"); //Good morning\n    function message(name) {\n      console.log(name);\n    }\n    ```\n    This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.\n    **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

The closure has three scope chains.\n    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets\n    2. Outer function's variables\n    3. Global variables\n    Let's take an example of closure concept,\n    ```javascript\n    function Welcome(name) {\n      var greetingInfo = function (message) {\n        console.log(message + \" \" + name);\n      };\n      return greetingInfo;\n    }\n    var myFunction = Welcome(\"John\");\n    myFunction(\"Welcome \"); //Output: Welcome John\n    myFunction(\"Hello Mr.\"); //output: Hello Mr. John\n    ```\n    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.\n    **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,\n     ```javascript\n     // Initialize an array a\n     for (let i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0);\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

  {
    "question": "How do you declare namespace",
    "answer": "Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects , IIFE to create namespaces.\n     1. **Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation\n     ```javascript\n     var namespaceOne = {\n        function func1() {\n            console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n        }\n     }\n     var namespaceTwo = {\n          function func1() {\n              console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n          }\n      }\n     namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition\n     namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition\n     ```\n     2. **Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.\n     ```javascript\n     (function () {\n       function fun1() {\n         console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n       }\n       fun1();\n     })();\n     (function () {\n       function fun1() {\n         console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n       }\n       fun1();\n     })();\n     ```\n     3. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.\n     ```javascript\n     {\n       let myFunction = function fun1() {\n         console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n       };\n       myFunction();\n     }\n     //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n     {\n       let myFunction = function fun1() {\n         console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n       };\n       myFunction();\n     }\n     //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the second loop is `4 4 4 4`.\n     Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration.

If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.\n     **Example**\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetails = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 25,\n       expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n     };\n     ```\n     to create a duplicate\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!\n     ```\n     if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:\n     ```javascript\n     empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";\n     ```\n     The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.\n     **Deep copy:**\n     A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\n     **Example**\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetails = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 25,\n       expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n     };\n     ```\n     Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n       name: empDetails.name,\n       age: empDetails.age,\n       expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n     };\n     ```\n     Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "Does javascript uses mixins",
    "answer": "Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one `[[prototype]]` for an object.\n     But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.\n     Say for instance, we've two classes `User` and `CleanRoom`. Suppose we need to add `CleanRoom` functionality to `User`, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.\n     ```javascript\n     // mixin\n     let cleanRoomMixin = {\n       cleanRoom() {\n         alert(`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now`);\n       },\n       sayBye() {\n         alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);\n       },\n     };\n     // usage:\n     class User {\n       constructor(name) {\n         this.name = name;\n       }\n     }\n     // copy the methods\n     Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);\n     // now User can clean the room\n     new User(\"Dude\").cleanRoom(); // Hello Dude, your room is clean now!\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object.

A _reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow.

    "answer": "The self string can be formed with the combination of `[]()!+` characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.\n     1. Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false\n     2. As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === \"\"\n     3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1\n     By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions\n     ```javascript\n     (![] + [] === \"false\" + !+[]) === 1;\n     ```\n     Now the character pattern would be created as below,\n     ```javascript\n           s               e               l               f\n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n      (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]\n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +\n     (![] + [])[+[]]\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n     (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "How to cancel a fetch request",
    "answer": "Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.\n     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,\n     1. Create an `AbortController` instance\n     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal\n     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal\n        For example, passing the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,\n     ```javascript\n     const controller = new AbortController();\n     const { signal } = controller;\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests\n     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is web speech API",
    "answer": "Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API was introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts:\n     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.\n        The example below shows how to use this API to get text from speech,\n     ```javascript\n     window.SpeechRecognition =\n       window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF\n     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();\n     recognition.onresult = (event) => {\n       // SpeechRecognitionEvent type\n       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;\n       console.log(speechToText);\n     };\n     recognition.start();\n     ```\n     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone\n     1. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.\n        For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,\n     ```javascript\n     if (\"speechSynthesis\" in window) {\n       var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(\"Hello World!\");\n       speech.lang = \"en-US\";\n       window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);\n     }\n     ```\n     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.\n     **Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is minimum timeout throttling",
    "answer": "Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.\n     **Browsers:** They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.\n     Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.\n     **Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.\n     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```\n     and the output would be in\n     ```cmd\n     Script loaded\n     My script is initialized\n     ```\n     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be sequential.\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     runMeFirst();\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```\n     and the output is,\n     ```cmd\n     My script is initialized\n     Script loaded\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is the purpose of queueMicrotask",
    "answer": "The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.\n     Example:\n     ```javascript\n     console.log(\"Start\"); //1\n     queueMicrotask(() => {\n       console.log(\"Inside microtask\"); // 3\n     });\n     console.log(\"End\"); //2\n     ```\n     By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "How do you prevent promises swallowing errors",
    "answer": "While using asynchronous code, JavaScriptâs ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.\n     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,\n     ```javascript\n     Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").then(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n     Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n     ```\n     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,\n     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\")\n          .then(function () {\n            throw new Error(\"error\");\n          })\n          .catch(function (error) {\n            console.error(error.stack);\n          });\n        ```\n        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.\n     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").done(function () {\n          throw new Error(\"error\");\n        });\n        ```\n        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp()\n          .then(function (result) {\n            return processDataAsync(result);\n          })\n          .done(function (processed) {\n            displayData(processed);\n          });\n        ```\n        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {\n          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));\n        });\n        ```\n        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.\n     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**\n        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a âdefaultâ onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {\n          throw error;\n        });\n        ```\n        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {});\n        ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

But you can make the object iterable by defining a `Symbol.iterator` property on it.\n     Let's demonstrate this with an example,\n     ```javascript\n     const collection = {\n       one: 1,\n       two: 2,\n       three: 3,\n       [Symbol.iterator]() {\n         const values = Object.keys(this);\n         let i = 0;\n         return {\n           next: () => {\n             return {\n               value: this[values[i++]],\n               done: i > values.length,\n             };\n           },\n         };\n       },\n     };\n     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // â {value: 1, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // â {value: 2, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // â {value: 3, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // â {value: undefined, done: true}\n     ```\n     The above process can be simplified using a generator function,\n     ```javascript\n     const collection = {\n       one: 1,\n       two: 2,\n       three: 3,\n       [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {\n         for (let key in this) {\n           yield this[key];\n         }\n       },\n     };\n     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is a Proper Tail Call",
    "answer": "First, we should know about tail call before talking about \"Proper Tail Call\". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.\n     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return 1;\n       }\n       return n * factorial(n - 1);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```\n     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return acc;\n       }\n       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```\n     The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

Since JS engine is single threaded there will be only one global environment and there will be only one global execution context.\n     For example, the below code other than code inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.\n     ```javascript\n     var x = 10;\n     function A() {\n       console.log(\"Start function A\");\n       function B() {\n         console.log(\"In function B\");\n       }\n       B();\n     }\n     A();\n     console.log(\"GlobalContext\");\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is debouncing?",
    "answer": "Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance_. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.\n     Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using `clearTimeout` and reschedule API call/DB query for a new timeâ300 ms in the future.\n     ```js\n     function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {\n       let timer;\n       return (...args) => {\n         clearTimeout(timer);\n         timer = setTimeout(() => {\n           func.apply(this, args);\n         }, timeout);\n       };\n     }\n     function fetchResults() {\n       console.log(\"Fetching input suggestions\");\n     }\n     const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());\n     ```\n     The _debounce()_ function can be used on input, button and window events\n     **Input:**\n     ```html\n     <input type=\"text\" onkeyup=\"processChange()\" />\n     ```\n     **Button:**\n     ```html\n     <button onclick=\"processChange()\">Click me</button>\n     ```\n     **Windows event:**\n     ```html\n     window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", processChange);\n     ```\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "answer": "It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,\n     1. Array.isArray() method:\n        The `Array.isArray(value)` utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        Array.isArray(numbers); // true\n        Array.isArray(user); //false\n        ```\n     2. instanceof operator:\n        The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is an Array other false for other type.\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        console.log(numbers instanceof Array); // true\n        console.log(user instanceof Array); // false\n        ```\n     3.

    "answer": "Pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of a value. Primitives such as string, number, boolean etc will actually create a new copy. Hence, updating one value doesn't impact the other value. i.e, The values are independent of each other.\n     ```javascript\n     let a = 5;\n     let b = a;\n     b++;\n     console.log(a, b); //5, 6\n     ```\n     In the above code snippet, the value of `a` is assigned to `b` and the variable `b` has been incremented. Since there is a new space created for variable `b`, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable `a`.\n     Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.\n     ```javascript\n     let user1 = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 27,\n     };\n     let user2 = user1;\n     user2.age = 30;\n     console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30\n     ```\n     In the above code snippet, updating the `age` property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference.\n     **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

They allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This means that a function defined within another function can access variables from the outer function, even if the outer function has already returned.\nHere are some common use cases of closures:\n*  Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods. By defining variables within a function's scope and returning inner functions that have access to those variables, you can create     a form of encapsulation, limiting access to certain data or functionality.\n*  Function Factories: Closures are often used to create functions with pre-set parameters. This is useful when you need to create multiple functions with similar behavior but different configurations.\n*  Callback Functions: Closures are frequently used in asynchronous programming, such as handling event listeners or AJAX requests. The inner function captures variables from the outer scope and can access        them when the callback is invoked.\n*  Memoization: Closures can be used for memoization, a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls. The inner function can remember the results of previous calls and      return the cached result if the same input is provided again.\n*  iterators and Generators: Closures can be used to create iterators and generators, which are essential for working with collections of data in modern JavaScript.\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "answer": "Both map and forEach functions are used to iterate over an arrays but there are some differences in their functionality.\n     1. **Returning values:** The `map` method returns a new array with transformed elements whereas `forEach` method returns `undefined` eventhough both of them are doing the same job.\n      ```javascript\n        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        arr.map(x => x * x); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n        arr.forEach(x => x * x); // \n        \n        The `forEach()` method in JavaScript always returns undefined. This is because forEach() is used to iterate over arrays and perform side effects on each element, rather than returning a `new array or transforming the original array`\n      ```\n     2. **Chaining methods:** The `map` method is chainable. i.e, It can be attached with `reduce`, `filter`, `sort` and other methods as well. Whereas `forEach` cannot be attached with any other methods because it returns `undefined` value.\n      ```javascript\n        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        arr.map(x => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); // 55\n        arr.forEach(x => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur);; //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefine(reading 'reduce')\n      ```\n     3. **Mutation:** The `map` method doesn't mutate the original array by returning new array. Whereas `forEach` method also doesn't mutate the original array but it's callback is allowed to mutate the original array.\n     **Note:** Both these methods existed since ES5 onwards.\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What are the event phases of a browser?",
    "answer": "There are 3 phases in the lifecycle of an event propagation in JavaScript,\n     1. **Capturing phase:** This phase goes down gradually from the top of the DOM tree to the target element when a nested element clicked. Before the click event reaching the final destination element, the click event of each parent's element must be triggered.\n     2. **Target phase:** This is the phase where the event originally occurred reached the target element .\n     3. **Bubbling phase:** This is reverse of the capturing phase. In this pase, the event bubbles up from the target element through it's parent element, an ancestor and goes all the way to the global window object.\n     \n     The pictorial representation of these 3 event phases in DOM looks like below,\n     \n     ![Screenshot](images/event-flow.png)\n  **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What are hidden classes?",
    "answer": "Since JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, you can add or remove properties and methods from objects on the fly at runtime. This nature of JavaScript increases the dynamic dictionary lookups(because objects implemented as HashTables in memory) for retrieving a property on an object. \n     Let's consider the following example to see how the additional properties `age` and `gender` added at runtime.\n     ```javascript\n      function Person(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n      }\n      var person1 = new Person('John');\n      var person2 = new Person('Randy');\n      person1.age = 40;\n      person1.gender = \"Male\";\n      person2.gender = \"Female\";\n      person2.age = 50;\n     ```\n    \n     As a result, this behavior leads to lower JavaScript performance compared to the contiguous buffer method used in non-dynamic languages. The V8 engine provided a solution named **hidden classes** to optimize the access time when retrieving a property on an object. This optimization is achieved by sharing hidden classes among objects created in a similar fashion. These hidden classes are attached to each and every object to track its shape.\n    \n     When V8 engine sees the constructor function(e.g, Person) is declared, it creates a hidden class (let's say Class01) without any offsets. Once the first property assignment statement (`this.name = name`) is executed, V8 engine will create a new hidden class (let's say Class02), inheriting all properties from the previous hidden class (Class01), and assign the property to offset 0. This process enables compiler to skip dictionary lookup when you try to retrieve the same property(i.e, name). Instead, V8 will directly point to Class02. The same procedure happens when you add new properties to the object. \n     \n     For example, adding `age` and `gender` properties to `Person` constructor leads to transition of hidden classes(Class02 -> Class03 -> Class04). If you create a second object(Person2) based on the same Person object, both Class01 and Class02 hidden classes are going to be shared. However, the hidden classes Class03 and Class04 cannot be shared because second object has been modified with a different order of properties assignment. \n     \n     Since both the objects(person1 and person2) do not share the hidden classes, now V8 engine cannot use **Inline Caching** technique for the faster access of properties. \n  **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What is inline caching?",
    "answer": "Inline caching is an optimization technique based on the observation that repeated calls to same function tends to occur on same type of objects. The V8 compiler stores a cache of the type of objects that were passed as a parameter in recent method calls. Upon next time when same function is called, compiler can directly search for the type in cache.\n  Let's consider an example where the compiler stores the shape type in cache for repeated calls in the loop.\n  ```js\n    let shape = {width : 30,  height: 20}; // Compiler store the type in cache as { width: <int>, height: <int>} after repeated calls\n    \n    function area(obj) {\n      //Calculate area\n    }\n    for(let i=0; i<100; i++) {\n      area(shape);\n    }\n  ```\n  After few successful calls of the same area method to its same hidden class, V8 engine omits the hidden class lookup and simply adds the offset of the property to the object pointer itself. As a result, it increases the execution speed.\n  There are mainly 3 types of inline caching possible:\n  1. Monomorphic: This is a optimized caching technique in which there can be always same type of objects passed.\n  2. Polymorphic: This ia slightly optimized  caching technique in which limited number of different types of objects can be passed.\n  3. Megamorphic: It is an unoptimized caching in which any number of different objects can be passed.\n  **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

    "question": "What are the different ways to execute external scripts?",
    "answer": "There are three different ways to execute external scripts,\n       1. async: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available even before parsing completes. The parsing of the page is going to be interuppted once the script is downloaded completely and then the script is executed. Thereafter, the parsing of the remaining page will continue.\n          The syntax for async usage is as shown below,\n          ```html\n          <script src=\"demo.js\" async></script>\n          ```\n       2. defer: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.\n      \n          The syntax for defer usage is as shown below,\n          ```html\n          <script src=\"demo.js\" defer></script>\n          ```\n       3. Neither async or defer: The script is downloaded and executed immediately by blocking parsing of the page until the script execution is completed.\n       **Note:** You should only use either async or defer attribute if the `src` attribute is present.\n    **[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**"

The ! operator operates on either `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString`, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both `!typeof myNumber` and `!typeof myString` is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.\nTo make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:\n```\nif (!(typeof myNumber === \"string\"))\n```\nOr simply use the inequality operator:\n```\nif (typeof myNumber !== \"string\")\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n---\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n#### 33.

So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.\n```javascript\nconsole\n  .log(\"First line\")\n  [(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")].forEach((element) => console.log(element));\n```\nHence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.\n</p>\n</details>\n---\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n#### 62.

In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object.\nThe above pit fall fixed by three ways,\n1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object.\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var eatFruit = () => {\n      console.log(this);\n    };\n    eatFruit();\n  },\n};\nuser.eat();\n```\nThe next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced.\n2.  It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced.\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var self = this;\n    var eatFruit = () => {\n      console.log(self);\n    };\n    eatFruit();\n  },\n};\nuser.eat();\n```\n3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object.\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var eatFruit = function () {\n      console.log(this);\n    };\n    return eatFruit.bind(this);\n  },\n};\nuser.eat()();\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n---\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n#### 72.

So when you try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial value `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which will result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block value(`John`) will be garbage collected.\n</p>\n</details>\n---\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n#### 73.

This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below,\n```javascript\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  try {\n    console.log(\"try block\");\n    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`);\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(\"Error: \", err);\n  }\n}, 1000);\n```\nYou can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code.\n</p>\n</details>\n---\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n#### 79.

That is the reason you will endup with reference error for second function call.\nBut if the second function is invoked in the first function itself, there won't be any reference error.\n```javascript\nprintHello();\nfunction printHello() {\n  printMessage();\n  console.log('Hello')\n  function printMessage() {\n    console.log(\"Good day\")\n  }\n}\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n---\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n#### 83. What is the time taken to execute below timeout callback?\n```javascript\n  console.log(\"Start code\");\n  setTimeout(function() {\n      console.log(\"Callback code\");\n  }, 5000);\n  console.log(\"After callback\");\n  let startTime = new Date().getTime();\n  let endTime = startTime;\n  while(endTime <= startTime + 10000) {\n      endTime = new Date().getTime();\n  }\n  console.log(\"End code\");\n```\n- 1: > 10 sec\n- 2: Immediately\n- 3: < 10 sec\n- 4: <= 5sec\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n##### Answer: 1\nEven though there is a timer of 5 seconds supplied to `setTimeout` callback, it won't get executed until the main thread is free and finished executing the remaining part of the code. In this example, the remaining code(while loop) takes 10seconds to finish it's execution. In the mean time, the callback will be stored in callback queue upon completion of its 5 seconds timer. After 10 seconds, the callback will be moved to callstack because the callstack is empty by poping out global execution context. \n</p>\n</details>\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n#### 84. What is the output of below code?\n```javascript\nlet arr = ['wÃ¶chentlich','Woche', 'wÃ¤re', 'Wann'];\nconsole.log(arr.sort());\n```\n- 1: ['wÃ¶chentlich','Woche', 'wÃ¤re', 'Wann']\n- 2: ['Wann', 'wÃ¤re', 'Woche', 'wÃ¶chentlich']\n- 3: ['Wann', 'Woche', 'wÃ¤re', 'wÃ¶chentlich']\n- 4: ['wÃ¤re', 'Wann', 'wÃ¶chentlich','Woche']\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n##### Answer: 3\nJavascript has a native method sort that allows sorting an array of elements in-place. It will treat each element as a string and sort it alphabetically. But if you try to sort an array of strings which has non-ASCII characters, you will receive a strange result. This is because characters with an accent have higher character codes. \nIn this case, the sort order of an array is ['Wann', 'Woche', 'wÃ¤re', 'wÃ¶chentlich'].\nIf you want to sort an array of string values which has non-ASCII characters in an ascending order,  there are two possible options like **localeCompare** and **Intl.Collator** provided by ECMAScript Internationalization API.\n**localeCompare:**\n```javascript\nlet arr = ['wÃ¶chentlich','Woche', 'wÃ¤re', 'Wann'];\nconsole.log(arr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b))); //['Wann', 'wÃ¤re', 'Woche', 'wÃ¶chentlich']\n```\n**Intl.Collator:**\n```javascript\nlet arr = ['wÃ¶chentlich','Woche', 'wÃ¤re', 'Wann'];\nconsole.log(arr.sort(Intl.Collator().compare)); //['Wann', 'wÃ¤re', 'Woche', 'wÃ¶chentlich']\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n**[â¬ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n \n## Disclaimer\nThe questions provided in this repository are the summary of frequently asked questions across numerous companies.
